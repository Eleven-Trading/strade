# strade
strade is a simple and open source momentum stock scanner and screener, giving you alerts when the price or volume of a stock increases.

# The project
## Motivation
Trade Ideas is a great and very powerful stock scanner. However, I thought it was a little bit too complicated for my need (day trading) and I could not find the correct settings for finding the right stocks for day trading. 

## Features
- Voice assistant for announcing stocks
- Customize the scan to your preferences (price range, volume range, etc.)
- Color code for filtering out the best stocks
- Stocks are listed in a table where you can quickly see price, volume, float, etc.
